# Project2BookingSystem

My name is Sarina. My strenghts are html syntax and I have good design ideas. My weaknesses are JavaScript, my javascript has been as simple as possible thus far,
and baseline grid formatting.

My name's Rosana Sincere. My strengths include attention to syntax and detail. My weeknesses include lack of experience using git commands.

The Proposal:
Our group is a team of two consisting of Rosana and I. We have decided to do a Movie Ticket sales booking system. We'll be using Google Hangouts to communicate.

Here is the link to our shared repository: https://github.com/ITMD362Project2/Project2BookingSystem

My Fork: https://github.com/Sarina-Stoker/Project2BookingSystem
